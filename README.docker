## Docker utility for devel

The current implementation of Docker was designed for the sole purpose of test and debugging. It can
compile images under different branches, configures the build with verbose options, and it has two phases  
(core and extensions Dockerfiles).  

The generated images are not applicable for Production environments.

## (Phase 2): Extensions local image build

```bash
docker build -t babelfish_dev .
```

## Starting the cluster

```bash
docker run --name bbf -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
  -e BABELFISH_USER=bbf -e BABELFISH_PASS=bbf \
  -e BABELFISH_DB=bbf -d babelfish_dev
```

Verify that your image started up:

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                         COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                NAMES
2bd299d802c9   babelfish_dev                 "/usr/local/bin/entrâ€¦"   7 seconds ago   Up 7 seconds   1433/tcp, 5432/tcp   bbf
```

Clean up by: 

```bash
docker rm bbf
```
